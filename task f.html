<h1>AMONG US</h1>

<p class="borderexample"><b>Among Us</b> is an online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American[4] game studio InnerSloth and released on June 15, 2018. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors.The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate at any time. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed; Imposters win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.</p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<p class="borderexample"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us">Visit Wikipedia.com!</a>Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to ten players. One to three players (depending on what the host selected) are chosen to be the impostor(s) each round. A game can take place on one of three maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld", a headquarters building called "Mira HQ", or a planet base called "Polus"In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as the vision range of the Crewmates and the Impostors, and the allowed number of emergency meetings..</p>
<p class="borderexample">At the start of the game, Crewmates are given "tasks" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as electrical rewiring and engine refueling. Impostors are given a fake list of tasks to blend in with Crewmates, although they are unable to actually complete any task. Impostors can sabotage vital systems, covertly travel through air vents, and work with other Impostors to kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, are invisible to everyone except other ghosts, and are limited in their capacity to interact with the world; however, they must still complete their tasks.[17][18] All players except ghosts[19] have a limited cone of vision, only allowing them to see other players within a certain unblocked distance around them.</p>
<h2>How to  win the game</h2>
<p class="borderexample"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnpjpdhUNjY">Watch online tutorial!</a>The Crewmates win by completing all tasks, or by identifying and eliminating all Impostors. The Impostors win when the number of Impostors is equal to the number of Crewmates, or when a sabotage countdown reaches zero. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing sabotages (as an Impostor). When an Impostor performs a sabotage, either there is an immediate consequence (such as all the lights being turned off) or a countdown begins. In the latter case, if the sabotage is not resolved before the countdown finishes, the Impostors win. Sabotages can be resolved by living players in varying ways depending on which sabotage is performed.[16][17][18] Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition; a player quitting is equivalent to them being eliminated, and a Crewmate quitting leads to their tasks being considered completed for the total</p>
